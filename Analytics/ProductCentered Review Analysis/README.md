# Review Analysis and Report Generation

As online marketplaces have been popular during the past decades, the online sellers and merchants ask their purchasers to share their opinions about the products they have bought. As a result, millions of reviews are being generated daily which makes it difficult for a potential consumer to make a good decision on whether to buy the product. Analyzing this enormous amount of opinions is also hard and time consuming for product manufacturers. Moreover, product reviews and ratings are tentative for buyer and manufacturer consideration as they often include opinion about e-commerce service. Exclusive product review study is crucial for both manufacturers and consumers which is complicated. 
Project focuses on resolving these difficulties and formatting the data for better understanding. 
Product rating and summary is generated from the filtered reviews with opinion mining powered by scalable text summarization techniques.
